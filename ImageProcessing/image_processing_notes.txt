Rescaling
- INTER_AREA   	- shrink image
- INTER_CUBIC	- scale image
- INTER_LINEAR	- enlarge image with faster performance
Blurring - Blurring is achieved by convolving the image with low pass filter kernel
    - we use low pass filter to remove noise from image or blurring image
    - we use high pass filter to find edges in images
- Averaging
   - we give equal weight to each pixel in kernel
- Gaussian
  - almost similar to averaging but instead of using simple mean is uses weighted mean, where neighbour pixels that are closer to central pixel contributes more weight to average
   - here we can specify standard deviation in x and y direction -> sigmax and sigmay
- Median
   - central element in kernel area is replaced with median of all pixels under the kernel
- Bilateral
   - highly effective in noise removal while keeping edges sharp
Thresholding
   - if pixel value is smaller than particular threshold it is set to 0, otherwise set to max value
